Create a launcher as Irrlicht app, which intially tests all
graphics devices and creates the list of accesible ones.
Next, user can pick resolution params, fullscreen, shadows, etc.
Finally, there'll be a tab with world generation (or loading)
settings. E.g. World Configuration Manager

Launcher dumps all data collected in a single textfile that
will be read by launch script.

Basic driver is Irrlicht's native softrender. Assume it'll work on all platforms :)
