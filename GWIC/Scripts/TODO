Launch script is a main init for GWIC.

1. Set env vars. Maybe pkgconf using...
1.p Recreate the VFS tree in current working dir. There'll be all user-created data.
2. Fire up the Launcher.
3. If launcher was not cancelled, read a file with initial settings and xargs it to main GWIC executable.
4. (?) control the app running and if it crashed, create minidump or something
